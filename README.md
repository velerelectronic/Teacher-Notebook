Teacher Notebook

Origins
-------
An application called Esquirol was created to help the teacher in several tasks. It was written in HTML5+JavaScript+CSS using Apache Cordova. There are two main reasons to change the name and the project:

* The name did not express the purpose of the application. "Teacher Notebook" reminds us that the application will be used as a notebook.
* We want to use Qt as a general framework to address a wide range of platforms: Android, iOS, Desktop, etc.


Main features
-------------
* Schedule to organize tasks
* Annotations list
* Assessment grids
* Teaching Plannings in XML format (read-only)

* Basic stopwatch
